# Styling Guide
Our organisation have set up some guidelines for styling code, so that it is homogeneous on all of our projects, these styling rules must be followed.

# Java Styling Guide
- The starting curly brace `{` of the functions body should be after the parenthesis `()` of the function, with a space between them
  ```java
  void foo() {
             ^
             |
          Like this
  ```
- The ending ending curly brace `}` should be at the same indent level as of the starting line.
  ```java
  {
      void foo() {
      }
  }
  ```
- Use 4 space indention, and don't use tab character.
